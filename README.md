## Projects
### [AURA](https://github.com/douglasta2024/AURA)
**Tags:** Deep Learning, Multi-modal, Transformers, CNN, Electrical Engineering

**Languages/Frameworks:** Python, Arduino

This project aimed to create a multi-modal application that would allow users to interact with drones through speech commands alone. The foundation deep learning model, Wav2Vec2, that was utilzized in this project combined a transformer and CNN to achieve audio to text classification. The transformer from this model was responsible for converting the audio data into signals for the CNN to perform classification onto. A link to a video demonstration is provided in the repository.

### [Resilitree](https://github.com/douglasta2024/ResiliTree)
**Tags:** Natural Disaster Prevention, Deep Learning, CNN

**Frameworks/Languages:** Python, Pytorch

This project was originally built during IBM's UF Hackathon in the Fall of 2024. The goal of this project was to assist people in need during hurricane season and increase treefall awareness in Florida. Resilitree utilizes a CNN as the backbone of the architecture to classify common Florida trees that are susceptable to treefall during hurricane season. Traits such as leaf foiliage and holes in the base of the tree are some common traits that helped Resilitree identify if a tree needed to be secured before a hurricane.

### [Augmented Stock Market AI Assistant](https://github.com/douglasta2024/Augmented-Stock-Market-AI-Assistant) *---In Progress---*
**Tags:** Stock Market, NLP, RAG, Machine Learning, Web Scraping

**Frameworks/Languages:** Python, Google ADK, React, Selenium

The purpose of this project to make stock market research more accessible to its users by serving information about the current state of markets through an agentic workflow.
